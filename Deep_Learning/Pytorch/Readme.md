## Deep Learning in Pytorch
This folder includes files about deep learning in Pytorch, including 3 main parts: ANN, CNN and RNN. 

This also covers the Gradient Descent, Overfitting, cross-validation, Regularization, Meta-parameters optimization, Performance metrics which are same from Machine Learning. 

Besides, it including some deep learning specific topices including Autoencoders, Transfer Learning, Style Transfer, Generative adversarial networks and running on the GPU.
