## Basic Concepts
<br>1. Population: The collection of all subjects of interest.
<br>2. Sample: A subgroup of population from what we collect information.
<br>3. Sample Size: The number of subjects in a sample.
<br>4. Sample space: A list of all possible outcomes. 
<br>5. Parameter: Any summaries obtained from population.
<br>6. Statistics: Any summaries obtained from sample. 
<br>7. Outlier: Extreme data which are not in the main body of the distribution.
<br>8. Leverage: Measure how far away the independent variable values of an observation from other observations. If deleting the leverage point can change the estimate a lot, then this is called influential point.
<br>9. Deviation: The difference between the observation and the mean. 
<br>10. Degrees of freedom: Numbers of observations that can be freely changed in a sample.
<br>11. Standard deviation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. Only used as a measrue of spread when mean is used as the measure of center. 
<br>12. Event: Any combinations of outcomes.
<br>13. Central Limit Theorem: When sample size is sufficiently large, the sample distribution of the sample mean always follows normal distribution.
<br>14. Law of large numbers: When sample size tends to infinitely, sample mean equals the population mean. 
<br>15. If repeated samples were taken and the 95% confidence interval was computed for each sample, then 95% of these confidence intervals cover the true mean.




## Hypothesis Test
<br>1. Definition: Hypothesis test is an inference tool that examines if the hypotheses are supported by the sample data.
<br>2. Hypothesis types: (1) Equality: Not too much difference on two treatments. (2) Non-inferiority: Aim to show the experiment is not worse than standards. (3) Superiority: Experiment is better than the standard. 
<br>3. Statistical Hypothesis procedures: (1) State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis; (2) Specify the significance level; (3) Calculate the test statistics; (4) Calculate the p-value and reject region; (5) State the conclustion. 
<br>4. Hypothesis requirements: Must be specified in terms of parameters; (2) Must be in pair.
<br>5. Test statistics: The numerical summary of the data, which aims to measure the distance between what is observed in the sample data and what is expected under H0. 
<br>6. p-value: Probability of the observed data if H0 is ture, which used to quantify the statistical significance. 
<br>7. Steps for calculating the power: (1) Obtain the value for mean under H0 and Ha; (2) Superimpose the distribution of the sample mean under H0 and Ha; (3) Identify the reject region with respect to sample mean under H0; (4) Identify the region corresponding to power with respect to sample mean distribution under Ha and compute the corresponding area.
