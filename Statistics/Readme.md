## Basic Concepts
<br>1. Population: The collection of all subjects of interest.
<br>2. Sample: A subgroup of population from what we collect information.
<br>3. Sample Size: The number of subjects in a sample.
<br>4. Sample space: A list of all possible outcomes. 
<br>5. Parameter: Any summaries obtained from population.
<br>6. Statistics: Any summaries obtained from sample. 
<br>7. Outlier: Extreme data which are not in the main body of the distribution.
<br>8. Leverage: Measure how far away the independent variable values of an observation from other observations. If deleting the leverage point can change the estimate a lot, then this is called influential point.
<br>9. Deviation: The difference between the observation and the mean. 
<br>10. Degrees of freedom: Numbers of observations that can be freely changed in a sample.
<br>11. Standard deviation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. Only used as a measrue of spread when mean is used as the measure of center. 
<br>12. Event: Any combinations of outcomes.
<br>13. Central Limit Theorem: When sample size is sufficiently large, the sample distribution of the sample mean always follows normal distribution.
<br>14. Law of large numbers: When sample size tends to infinitely, sample mean equals the population mean. 
<br>15. If repeated samples were taken and the 95% confidence interval was computed for each sample, then 95% of these confidence intervals cover the true mean.
