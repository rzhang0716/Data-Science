## Basic Concepts
1. Population: The collection of all subjects of interest.
2. Sample: A subgroup of population from what we collect information.<br>
3. Sample Size: The number of subjects in a sample.<br>
4. Sample space: A list of all possible outcomes. <br>
5. Parameter: Any summaries obtained from population.<br>
6. Statistics: Any summaries obtained from sample. <br>
7. Outlier: Extreme data which are not in the main body of the distribution.<br>
8. Leverage: Measure how far away the independent variable values of an observation from other observations. If deleting the leverage point can change the estimate a lot, then this is called influential point.<br>
9. Deviation: The difference between the observation and the mean. <br>
10. Degrees of freedom: Numbers of observations that can be freely changed in a sample.<br>
11. Standard deviation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. Only used as a measrue of spread when mean is used as the measure of center. <br>
12. Event: Any combinations of outcomes.<br>
13. Central Limit Theorem: When sample size is sufficiently large, the sample distribution of the sample mean always follows normal distribution.<br>
14. Law of large numbers: When sample size tends to infinitely, sample mean equals the population mean. <br>
15. If repeated samples were taken and the 95% confidence interval was computed for each sample, then 95% of these confidence intervals cover the true mean.<br>


## Hypothesis Test
<br>1. Definition: Hypothesis test is an inference tool that examines if the hypotheses are supported by the sample data.
<br>2. Hypothesis types: (1) Equality: Not too much difference on two treatments. (2) Non-inferiority: Aim to show the experiment is not worse than standards. (3) Superiority: Experiment is better than the standard. 
<br>3. Statistical Hypothesis procedures: (1) State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis; (2) Specify the significance level; (3) Calculate the test statistics; (4) Calculate the p-value and reject region; (5) State the conclustion. 
<br>4. Hypothesis requirements: Must be specified in terms of parameters; (2) Must be in pair.
<br>5. Test statistics: The numerical summary of the data, which aims to measure the distance between what is observed in the sample data and what is expected under H0. 
<br>6. p-value: Probability of the observed data if H0 is ture, which used to quantify the statistical significance. 
<br>7. Steps for calculating the power: (1) Obtain the value for mean under H0 and Ha; (2) Superimpose the distribution of the sample mean under H0 and Ha; (3) Identify the reject region with respect to sample mean under H0; (4) Identify the region corresponding to power with respect to sample mean distribution under Ha and compute the corresponding area. 


## ANOVA 
<br>1. Assumptions: (1) All samples means are normally distributed; (2) K samples are independent to each other; (3) Variance of all populations are equal.
<br>2. Implement ANOVA: (1) Specify H0 and Ha; (2) Specify the significance level; (3) Compute test statistics; (4) Compute p-value and draw conclusion. 
<br>3. Idea of ANOVA: Interest in test the euqality for K means but carry the analysis of variance. Because if all means are equal, the variance among all populations should be small. We use the within-group variance as a reference as ANOVA assumes equally between group variance.
<br>4. Disadvantage of ANOVA: It cannot tell which one is different. Therefore, we need further pair-wise comparison to find the different one.
<br>5. Two-way ANOVA: If a quantitative outcome and two categorical variables. 
<br>6. MANOVA: ANOVA with several dependent variables (multiple y). 
<br>7. Multiple comparisos:(1) Bonferroni procedure; (b) Tukey Procedure; (c) Scheffe Procedure.
